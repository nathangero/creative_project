                -<u>Quadruple</u>: pattern of one accented beat followed by a light beat, then a somewhat heavy beat, and then a final light beat. Prevalent in music like pop.<br>
                -<u>Non</u>: there's just no pattern. Gregorian chant<br>
                -<u>Mixed</u>: Changes between one pattern of meter to another. "The constant shifting just makes it more difficult to tap your toes as you listen."<br>
